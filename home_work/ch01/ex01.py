# You can use a minus sign to make
# a negative number like -2.
# What happens if you put a plus sign
# before a number? What about ++2?

# If we put a plus sign before a number
# python will create a literal positive
# number type (int or float accordingly)


# Put several plus and minus operators one
# after another accumulates and produces
# a single real number sign

# Two values with no operators between them
# will throw a interpreter error
